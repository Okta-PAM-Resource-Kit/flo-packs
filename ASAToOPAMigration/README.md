============================

This workflow has the mechanism to automate the ASA migration to OPA platform. It is anticipated that customer scenarios will vary so a flexible, semi-automated/semi-manual approach will work best. This can be tweaked for each customer and tuned over the period.

This workflow has been developed based on currently available features and APIs. There are still some outstanding features that are not currently covered as part of this workflow, such as:
Sudo entitlement
How to handle ASA bastions
