This article is to send a notification to the security team if a new user id is being created on any Okta PA protected resources. This will help the security team to identify new identities directly created on protected servers which are not discovered and being managed by the vault in Okta Privileged Access â€“ i.e. those accounts created outside the process and could represent a risk to an organization.
